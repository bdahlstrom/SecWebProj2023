# Recipe Search App

This app assists you finding ingredient lists and calories for recipes by executing searches by ingredients you'd like to use.

This app was created as a project for Secure Web App Development class.

This app is designed to assist with receipe searches using an API at https://www.edamam.com/

Eventually, this app will be able to email or text a user a list of the ingredients for a recipe they have chose, I hope!

# User Stories

As a parent, I want to be able to get ideas for recipes quickly so that I can spend less time figuring out what to feed the kids.

As a life-partner, I want to be able to efficiently find recipes so that I can spend less time fighting with my partner about what we are going to eat.

As a poor and hungry person, I want to be able to use the protein I have in my storage so that I don't waste food or money.

# Mis-user stories

As a threat actor, I want to be able to reroute those accessing recipes to my fake website using ARP cache-poisoning so that I can get user's information.

# Getting Started

From the search bar, type in whatever ingredient you're trying to use.

For example, using a search for 'Asparagus' will get you recipes that include 'Asparagus.'  

Default is set to 'Beef.'
